      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          eDashboard Cast allows you to show your eDashboard data on a
          Chromecast device and allows you to interact with eDashboard on
          Google Assistant devices with a screen.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">
        What are the eDashboard Cast requirements?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          eDashboard Cast requires a eDashboard installation that is
          accessible via HTTPS (the url starts with "https://").
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">What is eDashboard?</div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          eDashboard is worlds biggest open source home automation platform
          with a focus on privacy and local control. You can install Home
          Assistant for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io" target="_blank"

      <div class="section-header" id="https">
        Why does my eDashboard needs to be served using HTTPS?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          The Chromecast only works with websites served over HTTPS. This means
          that the eDashboard Cast app that runs on your Chromecast is
          served over HTTPS. Websites served over HTTPS are restricted on what
          content can be accessed on websites served over HTTP. This is called
          mixed active content (<a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content#Mixed_active_content"
            target="_blank"
            >learn more @ MDN</a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to get your eDashboard installation served over
          HTTPS is by signing up for
          <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com" target="_blank"
            >eDashboard Cloud by Nabu Casa</a
          >.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header" id="https">
        Why does eDashboard Cast require me to authorize my eDashboard
        instance?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          You're currently looking at the eDashboard Cast launcher
          application. This is a standalone application to launch eDashboard
          Cast on your Chromecast. Because Chromecasts do not allow us to log in
          to eDashboard, we need to supply authentication to it from the
          launcher. This authentication is obtained when you authorize your
          instance. Your authentication credentials will remain in your browser
          and on your Cast device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your authentication credentials or eDashboard url are never sent
          to the Cloud. You can validate this behavior in
          <a
            href="https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/tree/dev/cast"
            target="_blank"
            >the source code</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The launcher application exists to make it possible to use Home
          Assistant Cast with older versions of eDashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with eDashboard 0.97, eDashboard Cast is also built
          into the Lovelace UI as a special entities card row. Since the
          Lovelace UI already has authentication, you will be able to start
          casting right away.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">Wat does eDashboard Cast do?</div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          eDashboard Cast is a receiver application for the Chromecast. When
          loaded, it will make a direct connection to your eDashboard
          instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          eDashboard Cast is able to render any of your Lovelace views on
          your Chromecast. Things that work in Lovelace in eDashboard will
          work in eDashboard Cast:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Render Lovelace views, including custom cards</li>
          <li>
            Real-time data stream will ensure the UI always shows the latest
            state of your house
          </li>
          <li>Navigate between views using navigate actions or weblinks</li>
          <li>
            Instant updates of the casted Lovelace UI when you update your
            Lovelace configuration.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Things that currently do not work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Live videostreams using the streaming integration
          </li>
          <li>Specifying a view with a single card with "panel: true".</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header" id="https">
        How do I change what is shown on my Chromecast?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          eDashboard Cast allows you to show your Lovelace view on your
          Chromecast. So to edit what is shown, you need to edit your Lovelace
          UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          To edit your Lovelace UI, open eDashboard, click on the three-dot
          menu in the top right and click on "Configure UI".
        </p>

          Chromecast is a technology developed by Google, and is available on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Chrome (all platforms except iOS)</li>
          <li>Microsoft Edge (all platforms except iOS)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">Why do some custom cards not work?</div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          eDashboard needs to be configured to allow eDashboard Cast to
          load custom cards. Starting with eDashboard 0.97, this is done
          automatically. If you are on an older version, or have manually
          configured CORS for the HTTP integration, add the following to your
          configuration.yaml file:
        </p>
        <pre>
http:
  cors_allowed_origins:
    - https://cast.home-assistant.io</pre
        >
        <p>
          Some custom cards rely on things that are only available in the normal
          eDashboard interface. This requires an update by the custom card
          developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a custom card developer: the most common mistake is that
          LitElement is extracted from an element that is not available on the
          page.
